      <p>To see the photos that you want, just enter the Flickr album number in the box above. The photo album must be set to public.</p>
      <p>You will only need to enter this number once. As long as you are logged into Chrome, the album number will be saved.</p>
      <p>Flickr sometimes refers to albums as "photo sets". For instructions on locating the number,
